# gemList

A website for tracking played games and their achievements, review them and share them.

## Why gemList?

gemList is a project that I started to learn more about web development and to have a place to track my games and their
achievements.  
I wanted to have a place where I could see all the games I have played and the achievements I have unlocked.  
I also wanted to have a place where I could write reviews about the games I have played and share them with others.

There was no website that I could find that had all these features, so I decided to create my own.
